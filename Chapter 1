Chapter 1: The Weight of the Unseen
The Onyxspire Academy was a marvel of white marble and gold, floating high above the smog-choked slums of Valerius. Inside, the air was sweet and thin. Outside, the world was dying.
Cyprian didn't belong in the marble halls. He was a "Janitorial Squire," an E-Rank Null whose only job was to scrub the mana-scorch marks off the training room floors after the elite students were finished playing at being heroes.
"Missed a spot, Scrub," a voice sneered.
Cyprian didn't look up. He knew the voice. Dante Valerius, the heir to the city's founding house. Dante was an [A-Rank: Sun-Bringer]. He stood there in his silk uniform, smelling of expensive spices, his palm glowing with a gentle, condescending light.
"My apologies, Lord Dante," Cyprian muttered, his rag dripping with grey cleaning fluid.
"It’s a shame, really," Dante continued, stepping on Cyprian’s wet rag. "The System gave you a window, but no Class. You're like a spectator at your own funeral."
Cyprian looked at his own reflection in the polished floor. His Status Window was a mocking, empty blur.

Then, the marble floor beneath them didn't just shake—it screamed.
A sound like a thousand mirrors shattering at once filled the hall. The white walls cracked, bleeding a thick, black smoke. A Void Gate—a tear in the fabric of the world—erupted right in the center of the elite training wing.

[HUMAN NATURE PROTOCOL: ACTIVE]
From the tear emerged Grave-Stalkers—beasts made of grey muscle and exposed bone, with long, scythe-like fingers.
The students, who had spent years fighting simulated holograms, froze. The "Sun-Bringer," Dante, took one look at the gore-dripping jaw of a Grave-Stalker and felt his light flicker. He didn't charge. He didn't protect.
He grabbed the nearest person—a younger student—and threw them toward the beast to buy himself time to reach the heavy iron doors.
"Dante! Help me!" the boy shrieked as a stalker’s claw hooked into his shoulder.
Dante didn't look back. He slammed the door shut, locking it from the outside. He left a dozen of his own "inferiors" in the room with three monsters.
Cyprian watched from the corner, his cleaning bucket overturned. He saw the betrayal. He saw the raw, ugly truth of human nature: when the gold peels off, there’s only lead underneath.
Suddenly, Cyprian’s empty Status Window turned a violent, bruised purple.

> Note: You can now draw power from the pain of those around you. The more they suffer, the stronger you become.
The boy Dante had thrown was bleeding on the floor. His pain was a physical thing—a red mist rising from his skin. Cyprian felt a pull in his gut. He didn't feel pity; he felt a terrifying, predatory hunger.
He reached out his hand. The red mist from the dying boy flowed into Cyprian’s veins.
"I didn't ask for this," Cyprian whispered, his eyes turning a hollow, midnight black. "But I'm not the one who locked the door."
He stood up, the rag in his hand igniting with a dark, cold flame. One of the Grave-Stalkers turned, sensing a new, darker presence.
Cyprian didn't move like a hero. He moved like a man who had nothing left to lose, and for the first time in his life, the "Null" felt the weight of a soul.
