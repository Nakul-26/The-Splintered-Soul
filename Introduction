Understood. We'll strip away the ledger and start fresh with a more visceral, action-oriented power system that forces characters to confront their darkest impulses.
Let's establish the world of Aethelgard, where the "System" is less of a helper and more of a parasite that feeds on human conflict.
🔵 1. Current Story State (Context Lock)
 * Story Title: The Splintered Soul
 * Genre: Action / Dark Fantasy / Psychological
 * Current Arc: The Awakening of the Low-Born
 * Main Character Emotional State: Cyprian is exhausted, invisible, and fueled by a quiet, simmering resentment.
 * Current Stakes: A surprise "Gate Shiver" has hit a prestigious academy; survival depends on the very people the students usually mock.
 * Unresolved Conflicts: The deep class divide between the "Pure-Bloods" (natural high-rankers) and the "Servants" (manual laborers).
🔵 2. Arc Destination
 * Permanent Change: The social order of the Onyx spire Academy is shattered.
 * Who wins/loses: Cyprian gains the "Forbidden" class; the Academy’s star pupil is exposed as a fraud.
 * Truth Revealed: Mana doesn't come from the atmosphere; it is harvested from human suffering.
 * Emotional Note: A chilling realization that the "Monsters" inside the gates might be more honest than the humans outside them.
🔵 3. Power & Logic Rules
 * Power System: The Splinter. Users don't just "have" mana; they have to "break" a piece of their own psyche or someone else's to fuel a skill.
 * Limitations: Overusing skills leads to "Soul-Fraying"—loss of memory, emotion, or sanity.
 * Costs: Every high-tier spell requires an emotional or physical sacrifice.
 * Anti-Deus-Ex: No sudden level-ups without a corresponding "Loss."
🔵 4. Tone Lock
 * Visceral
 * Desperate
 * Provocative
